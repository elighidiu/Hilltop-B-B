### Our goal

The idea behind our project was to develop a website for our B&B, in order to attract more guests,
and make reservation more accessible for our customers.
Furthermore, they will get a better look regarding the accommodations and the surroundings.

### The repo's goal
We created this repo, so we can easily collaborate together on the project.

Github provided us version-control, and the possibility to deploy our pages.
